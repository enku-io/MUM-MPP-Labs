- The bug in this code is a result of polymorphism. When the Person Class checks for equality, it checks whether the object in comparison is 
   a Person object and names are equal and that the type is a Person. A PersonWithSalary class is an instance of Person class and this passes.
   However, there can exist two instances of PersonWithSalary that have the same name but different salary. Hence the proper checks aren't in place 
   to check equality.
