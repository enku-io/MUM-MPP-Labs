Does it make sense to use inheritance here? NO

Inheritance is an IS-A relationship between classes.

Cylinder has a circle but Circle is not a cylinder.

For example the design with inheritance inheritance we have the following issues:

 :- Cylinder has no compute area instead it has compute surface area and 
 	Circle has no surface area instead it has area.
 	
 	this creates a problem because compute area only exists in circle's context and cannot be accessed using
 	its super class which is a cylinder. this violates the concept of polymorphism.
 	
 :-  Even if we add compute area method in clyinder class to be overridden by circle class, we can solve
 	the problem doesnt benefit from reusable code. therefore its inheritance without the benefits of inheritace.
